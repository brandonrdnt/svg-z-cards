	* New fork: SVG-Z-cards 1.0, based on David Bellot's SVG-cards 2.0.1
	* made font face and symbol size modifications using Adobe Illustrator CS2
	* provided multiple versions of the card suite:
		- .ai Adobe Illustrator CS2 version
		- .svg Scalable Vector Graphics (DTD 1.1) version
		- .png Portable Network Graphics version
	* Since I used Adobe Illustrator CS2 to make edits, my resulting SVG file is over two-times as large as David's original (sorry!!).  I'd recommend using David's original work if size is an issue in your project.
